			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
			<p>When I work on any game it requires both the left and right side of my brain for different reasons. The right 			side is full of creative juices that inspire the story, theme and direction I approach to the game. With 				that done it’s up to the left side of my brain to help me reasonably and logically write the scripts and 				actually begin creating the game. Sometimes when I get stuck on making something work on a script I have to take 			a step back and think about how the code works and try to logically solve the issue I’m trying to complete. </p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>For the first week I have to say I was surprised at the workflow. The topics were fun but all the hype around 			the intensity of the course was maybe over zealous as it didn’t relate to the digital media program very much. We 			designed and played our board games many times over the week and it was  great and fun icebreaker to meet my 				classmates and work together collaboratively. It was a great experience working with the ABQ Film Tour Devs to 				try to make a short clip. I wasn’t very proud of the portion I edited but it was what I could do with my skills 			and the time I had. The experience was super useful though as I had never used premier and finally got to use a 			really good video editing tool. I look forward to working on the projects and really working hard as the weeks 				go on. I also promise to push myself for optimal growth so I can carve a path for my future throughout the 				bootcamp.</p>
